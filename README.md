# the-gym-Challenge

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the Gym Traning. The Gym challenge help us to improve our coding skills by building realistic projects.
In this exercise, we will use nextjs and css, Only clone the "Home" and "About" pages. Create the other pages as well, so that the menu is complete. But don't add any content.

### The challenge

The-gym-stripe-clone
Users should be able to:

- Try to implement the design below, using only Nextjs and tailwind If you need to write custom CSS, you may do so, but you should do it using BEM,
- When you start the project, immediately create a "development" branch where you will do all your coding,
- When you are finished, create one large pull request (dev > main), which will then be reviewed by the code reviewer of your gym,
- Focus on making your clone perfect on one breakpoint. If you have time, make it responsive on at least a second breakpoint (mobile and desktop).
- If you have even more time also make it responsive for tablet.
- If you are super fast and get all that done perfectly and are still left with time to spare, clone that modal, that pops up when you click one of the buttons.
